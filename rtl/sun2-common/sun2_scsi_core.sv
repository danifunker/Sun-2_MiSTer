// The Sun-2 SCSI host adapter, without the bus it plugs into.
//
// Sun built this interface twice -- as a dual-height VME board with a
// battery-backed clock (rtl/sun2-vme/sun2_vme_scsi.sv) and as a MultiBus card
// with four serial ports (rtl/sun2-multibus/sun2_mb_scsi.sv) -- and the two are
// the same design.  Their own Theory of Operation says so outright: "The SCSI
// bus interface is the same for both this board (for the P796 bus) and the
// Sun-2 Single Board.  The DMA controller is largely the same for both boards,
// but the circuit implementation details differ"
// (Inputs/doc/Sun-2_SCSI/Multibus_SCSI_Theory_Of_Operation_Aug83.pdf, section 2).
//
// **The software cannot tell them apart at all**, which is the strongest
// evidence available that this split is the right one, and it is checkable
// rather than an opinion:
//
//   * Inputs/sunos-34-src/sun/sys/sundev/screg.h declares ONE struct
//     scsi_ha_reg for both machines, with `intvec' carrying the sole comment
//     "interrupt vector for VMEbus versions".
//   * msun/sys/sunstand/sc.c and rsun/sys/sunstand/sc.c are byte-identical --
//     one scdoit(), one sc_wait(), no conditional anywhere.
//
// So everything a driver touches lives here, and each card keeps only what the
// backplane decides: where its window is, how many pages it has, what else is
// on it, and whether it supplies an interrupt vector.
//
// **There is no SCSI protocol chip on either board, and no DMA chip either.**
// The whole interface is discrete TTL and PALs -- an 8303 transceiver, Am2952
// latches for the Data Register, an F280 parity generator, 'LS461 counters for
// DMA.  So there is no datasheet part to model and no register layout to look
// up: what software sees is a sixteen-byte register file, and that file *is* the
// specification.  The NCR 5380 that Inputs/Wish5380 models, and the Am9516 UDC
// beside it, are the **Sun-3** arrangement -- sundev/si.c, which
// conf.sun2/files.sun2:72 marks `not-supported' on a Sun-2.
//
// The register file, from sundev/screg.h:11-22, confirmed against both
// schematics and against the Programmers' Manual's own table (p8):
//
//   +0x00  8   W   data      selection bitmask, 1 << target
//   +0x00  8   R   data      the trailing odd byte after an odd-length DMA read
//   +0x02  8   RW  cmd_stat  the PIO port for *all* of COMMAND, STATUS and
//                            MESSAGE IN -- touching it generates SCSI ACK, so
//                            software never handles the handshake itself
//   +0x04  16  RW  icr       control in the low bits, the SCSI lines in the high
//   +0x08  32  W   dma_addr  24 bits on VME, 20 on MultiBus -- DMA_ADDR_BITS
//   +0x0C  16  RW  dma_count ones' complement, and it counts *up* to 0xFFFF
//   +0x0F  8   W   intvec    VME only; see HAS_INTVEC, which does NOT mean
//                            "bus-error there"
//
// Two things about that table are easy to get wrong and silent when wrong.
// `data' and `cmd_stat' are even-byte registers, so they live on D15:8 (UDS);
// `intvec' is at an odd address and lives on D7:0 (LDS).  And `dma_count' is
// both the transfer counter and a plain read/write register: the *entire*
// existence test every driver performs is to write 0x6789 to it and read it
// back (sunstand/sd.c:63-67, sundev/sc.c:80-86), and sc_getstatus restores a
// saved value into it outside any transfer.
//
// What is NOT here, because it belongs to the card: the window decode, the
// acknowledge counter (which answers to the machine's C_S24 timeout, not to any
// device), and whatever else shares the board -- an MM58167 on the VME card, two
// Z8530s on the MultiBus one.
