// The Sun-2 video control register.
//
// One 16-bit register, the same on both machines and mapped by both boot PROMs
// at the same *virtual* address, 0xEE3800.  Only the page-map entry behind it
// differs:
//
//   2/50   TYPE 1 page 0x40   -- on-board I/O 0x020000
//   2/120  TYPE 0 page 0xF03  -- 0x781800, on the video board in the eighth
//                               megabyte, decoded from A19/A12/A11 alone and
//                               therefore aliased up to 0x7FFFFE
//
// The pixels are not here on either machine: they live in DDR3 and get there
// through the Wishbone bridge.
//
// Sources, which agree: the Architecture Manual section 6.3, struct videoctl in
// Inputs/sunos-34-src/.../mon/h/video.h, struct bw2cr in
// .../sun/sys/sundev/bw2reg.h, and Table 2-1 of the 2/120 video board manual
// (Inputs/doc/800-1187-01_2-120_Video_Board_Engr_Sep84.pdf, page 2-3).

//
// The Architecture Manual describes bits 11:8 differently for Machine Type 1 --
// 10:8 reserved and 11 an audio enable for a sound generator at 0x780800.  That
// is the device-layer abstraction, not this board: the 2/120 video board's own
// manual gives 11:8 as the J1600 configuration jumpers, read only, and marks
// 0x780800 NOT USED.  There is no sound generator on it.  bw2reg.h agrees with
// the board, and bw2reg.h is the driver that has to work on both machines.
//
// Four things about this are load-bearing:
//
//   * **The jumpers are sense inputs** on the real card (Engineering Manual
//     2.7.1, J1600) and the PROM reads them to decide what it is looking at.
//     A 1 in 1024_jumper makes it 1024x1024 instead of 1152x900, so that one
//     reads zero.  color_jumper is the machine's choice of console: 1 makes
//     finit() look for the CG2 colour board at VME 0x400000 and draw its
//     console there (doc/prom/README.md), so it is set exactly when the colour
//     board is fitted -- with none, finit() would give up on the display
//     entirely.
//
//   * **The register aliases across its whole 2 KiB page.**  There is no
//     address decode below bit 11 here, on purpose.  SunOS's bwtwoprobe()
//     reads offset 0 and offset 2 and requires them equal -- "the control
//     register is replicated every 2 bytes throughout the control page" -- and
//     returns "no frame buffer" if they differ.
//
//   * **copybase must be writable and read back -- but only bits 6:1.**  The
//     same probe writes 0x2A and then 0x54 into bits 7:1 and compares the whole
//     word each time.  Nothing ever uses the value, but the field has to behave
//     like a register.  Bits 7 and 0 are not part of it: the board manual says
//     they "can be written to by the processor, but only read back as a zero",
//     and bw2reg.h warns "vc_copybase & 0x81 == aberrant bits.  Don't depend on
//     'em!".  Both probe values have those two bits clear, so the distinction
//     is invisible to every piece of software in the tree -- it is here because
//     it is what the hardware does.
//
//   * **Reset clears it.**  "Initialization: cleared on reset."  The PROM
//     re-enables video unconditionally after every reset, so the state that
//     matters is that video is *off* until it does.
//
// Copy mode is a register bit here and nothing more.  On the real card, with
// copy_en set, a write anywhere in the 128 KiB of main memory selected by
// copybase was also written to the frame buffer, so SunOS could keep a fast
// shadow copy and let the hardware mirror it.  No software in the tree uses
// it: the monitor's path is behind an #ifdef COPYMODE that no Makefile
// defines, and no bwtwo line in any conf.sun2 config carries the flags that
// would turn it on.
//
// The vertical retrace interrupt is the same story.  It is level 4 and
// autovectored, the bits are here, and nothing in the tree ever sets int_en --
// BW2_INTENABLEMASK is only ever written as zero.  int reads back zero and
// nothing is asserted; if that ever changes, note that the real card clears
// the interrupt by momentarily dropping int_en rather than by writing int.
