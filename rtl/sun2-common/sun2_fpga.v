   // ------------------------------------------------------------------

   // load-bearing.  The Am9513 is "not affected by power-on resets, watchdog
   // resets, or 68010 resets" (Architecture Manual 6.8), and the two Z8530s
   // have no reset at all -- the part has no reset pin, and the board cannot
   // produce the RD+WR software reset because those two strobes come from
   // separate decoders enabled by Q.R/W and Q.R/W-.  So on real hardware all
   // three come up in whatever state they powered up in and are never
   // disturbed again.  The monitor's own initialisation is what puts them
   // right, and its power-up test -- reading counter 1's mode register back
   // and comparing against CLKM_DEFAULT, trap.s:117 -- works precisely
   // because the timer survives a reset.
   //
   // An FPGA still has to start somewhere.  z8530_scc.sv has no `initial'
   // blocks and no declaration initialisers, so with no reset at all every
   // register in it is X, and several stay X for ever rather than healing:
   // the FIFO gray pointers, the soft-reset counters and the interrupt
   // latches all have else-branch guards that evaluate to X and so never
   // assign.  That puts X on RR0 bit 7 -- ZSRR0_BREAK, the bit the NMI
   // debounce masks and compares against g_debounce at 0x5B6 -- which is the
   // spurious Abort again, with the X sitting directly on the bit instead of
   // reaching it by some path nobody pinned down.
   //
   // por_reset is that one reset: the machine being switched on.  It is
   // power_on, which top_fpga.v drives from the reset that comes from outside
   // the machine -- the FPGA's configuration, and on a MiSTer every reset
   // Main applies: the OSD's Reset, a core or MGL load.  Each of those is the
   // machine switched off and on, so the monitor must find counter 1 back at
   // its power-up 0x0B00; when it did not, it took the OSD's Reset for the
   // watchdog, printed `Watchdog reset!' and stopped at its prompt instead of
   // booting.  The watchdog and the RESET instruction come from inside the
   // machine and do not reach it, so a double bus fault is still told apart.
   // It replaces POR_n, which was an `initial' block with # delays --
   // simulation-only, and a second continuous driver on P_HALT_n besides.

   // the battery-backed time-of-day clock waits for it.  Switching a Sun off

   // That window was manufacturing essentially every protection violation this

   // program-counter values, four of them repeating exactly 4096 times --

   // pattern the PROM had just written (0x000, 0x333, 0xccc, 0xfff), not a
   // translation of anything.
   //
   // The PROM cannot be the source of real ones: it never deliberately

   // supervisor program fetches come from PROM untranslated, so an FC=6 PROM
   // fetch cannot take a protection fault at all.  Decisively: during PMconst
   // the bus error vector is still uninitialised (monreset does not install a
   // handler until sunmon.c:310), so a real Sun-2 taking 16,448 bus errors
   // there would double-fault on the first one.  It boots only because the
   // pulse lands too late in the cycle for the core to act on.
   //
   // With this term the reference boot reports 22 bus errors -- all timeouts,
   // matching the dozen or so device probes the PROM really does make -- and
   // the console is byte-identical to the 23,629 run.
   //
   // That was once marked STILL UNPROVEN, because the PROM generates *zero*
   // legitimate protection faults and a monitor boot therefore cannot show
   // whether the ~P_AS_n term preserves real ones or disables the mechanism.
   // SunOS supplies the missing run: it faults for copy-on-write and stack
   // growth constantly, and tools/ctxprobe cases A and H measure a protection

   // protection answer used to arrive at C_S8, one bus state later.  So a write
   // to a write-protected page was committed to memory and *then* refused.
   //
   // Measured with tools/ctxprobe case H, on the board: a page holding
   // c0ffee00, a longword write of 12345678 through `moves' at FC_UD, the entry
   // fa000181 (valid, user read and execute, USR_WRITE denied).  The fault was
   // raised correctly -- 0088 <VALID,PROTERR> -- and memory was left at
   // 1234ee00.  The write is two word cycles; the first committed before the
   // refusal and the second never issued, which is why only the high half
   // changed.
   //
   // SunOS 4.x fork is copy-on-write and arms it by removing write permission
   // (sys/vm/seg_vn.c, hat_chgprot(seg, ..., ~PROT_WRITE); anon_dup's comment
   // says it assumes the caller has done so).  So the first write after a fork
   // faults *and corrupts the page the fault was protecting*, and whichever
   // process keeps that page sees the damage.  On a stack it is a mangled
   // return address: init's child returns from fork's rts into its own stack
   // and runs until something is illegal.
   //
   // Reads are gated as well as writes.  A read of *memory* would not need it
   // -- the CPU discards the data when BERR ends the cycle -- but MATCH_DEV,
   // MATCH_MBMEM, MATCH_MBIO and MATCH_FBCTL are behind this same gate, and a
   // read there can have side effects: a status register that clears on read, a
   // FIFO data port, an interrupt acknowledge.  A refused access must reach
   // none of them, so "the CPU throws the data away" is not a reason to let the
   // cycle out.
   //
   // KNOWN OPEN, and it is not understood: a VME 2/50 with this gate stalls in
   // the PROM at "Probing I/O bus: ie", spinning at 0xEF07E8..F0, where the
   // same machine built from the same tree without the gate reaches a full
   // autoconfig -- 3 boots to 0, repeated from clean builds.  MultiBus is
   // unaffected and boots SunOS to a shell.
   //
   // The gate is *inert* on VME, which is what makes it strange.  The `prot'
   // capture mode triggers on PROTERR alone, is validated on MultiBus (it
   // catches SunOS's SEGINV faults), and armed one second after reset it never
   // fires on VME across four minutes -- so nothing there is ever refused and
   // MMU_OK is permanently 1.  Simulation agrees: the VME reference passes with
   // the gate, Ethernet included, with X-valued maps and with MAPS_ZERO=1.
   //
   // So the difference is not logic.  The suspicion is placement: MMU_OK adds a
   // term to eleven decode paths and gives MATCH_* a fresh combinational path
   // back through the page map, and the gated VME build carries a hold path of
   // 64 ps inside the Ethernet MAC's receive unit
   // (machine/ethernet/mac/u_ru/buf_addr_reg[3] -> acc_addr_reg[3]) that
   // MultiBus does not have among its tightest.  A margin that small is a
   // latent fault whatever provoked it; see BRINGUP.md.
   // The refusal holds for the rest of the cycle.
   //
   // MMU_REFUSE is gated by ~P_AS_n, so it drops the moment AS negates -- but
   // the C_S chain, and with it C_S6, only clears on the posedge *after* AS has
   // gone.  In that one clock MMU_OK read 1 again and every MATCH_* term above
   // it came true for a cycle the MMU had just refused.  For memory that is a
   // Wishbone request with nobody waiting for it: the DDR3 adapter latches a
   // request on its first clock and runs it to completion, ignores the next
   // cycle's request while it is busy, and hands that cycle the orphan's
   // acknowledge.  The bridge loads the refused page's word as the new cycle's
   // data and never issues the real read.
   //
   // That was the disk corruption, for most of the life of this investigation:
   // a user-mode page fault followed at once by a master's DVMA read gave the
   // master one halfword of the faulting process's memory -- the first of its
   // longword, and program text.  Caught on the Wukong's bus-history ILA
   // (2026-09-13, BERR on the CPU's read, `wb_cyc' raised a clock later with AS
   // gone, the orphan's `23ed584f' taken by the master's next read of a
   // different word) and reproduced in simulation by tb/tb_orphan_ack.sv,
   // where every wrong read returned the refused page's word.
